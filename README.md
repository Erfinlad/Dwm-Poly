# Dwm-Poly
A messy dwm build with polybar support

The build is a bit messy since I have patched it with patches that I don't use and didn't bother removing it.
It has support for slstatus with the color patch so you can apply colors and underlines and stuff to slstatus.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Patches (that I remember putting):
anybar
ipc
sgrstatus
switchtotag
xresources
fullgaps
underlinetags
swaptags
colorbar
=======
For Polybar you can use the standard polybar but I had problems with it so I recommend using the fork Polybar-Dwm-Module with full dwm module support. If you are using void linux such as myself you may want to install the development versions of the libraries since polybar will need them.
